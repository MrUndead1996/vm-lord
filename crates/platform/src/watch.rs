//! Watching the HCS compute systems VMLord owns.
//!
//! VMLord otherwise learns about its VMs only by asking: the enumeration
//! reports what state a compute system is in. It cannot report why a VM

//!
//! The enumeration remains the authority on VM state; this module adds the
//! facts the enumeration does not carry.
